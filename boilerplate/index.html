      And you as well must die, beloved dust, And all your beauty stand you in
      no stead; This flawless, vital hand, this perfect head, This body of flame
      and steel, before the gust Of Death, or under his autumnal frost, Shall be
      as any leaf, be no less dead Than the first leaf that fell,â€”this wonder
      fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altered, estranged, disintegrated, lost. Nor shall my love avail you in
      your hour. In spite of all my love, you will arise Upon that day and
      wander down the air Obscurely as the unattended flower, It mattering not
      how beautiful you were, Or how beloved above all else that dies.
    </p>
